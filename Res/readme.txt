It uses a very effective and powerfull cryptographic technique called Double Transposition Cipher, using a key of length 5.
There are three modues in the application :
    1.Front Module
    2.Encryption Modue
    3.Decryption Module

FIRST MODULE :
First module is quite simple, you just have to click on a specific button that highlights your desired objective(Ebcryption or Decryption ).

Nature of Software: Stand alone application compatible with every 32 bit Operating System .
Requires a 100mb free space and aminimum of 512mb RAM.

HOW TO INSTALL :
There is no need to install the application but you need to copy the application folder in 
C:\\ drive for various functionalities of the program to wark properly( Strictly only in C: drive and not even in any sub directory in C: drive).






**************************how to enter a key**********************************
The key that you choose plays an important role in this application, so it is important that 
you select and insert the right key.
Following points should be kept in mid while using the key :

         1.Length of your key should be Exactly five.
         2.Only use numbers as key elements and not alphabets or special characters
         3.Use the same key while encrpting as well as decrypting the content.
         4.Don't use spaces or press enter between the elements of the key, just simply              write five elements in continuation.
         5.Your key should only consist of numbers 1 to 5( 1,2,3,4,5 ).
         6.Your key could be any combination of numbers from 1 to 5
             ( 13245 or 51324 or 41325 etc ).
         7.Do not reapeat the key elements.( 12243 or 53121 or 12353).
